Hi there! I'm Roberto Vega, a computer science enthusiast pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Stockton University. My passion lies in leveraging technology to create impactful and scalable solutions.

Over the years, I've honed my skills in full-stack development, data analysis, and software engineering. Highlights of my projects include:

Nationwide Web-Based Hub System: A full-stack application leveraging Flask, AWS, and SQL to create a scalable, data-driven platform with GitHub integration for enhanced collaboration insights.
Lottery Machine: An interactive Java-based simulation using Java Swing, OOP principles, and Maven for seamless development and modularity.
My technical toolkit includes languages like Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and frameworks like Flask, React, and Node.js. I'm proficient with tools such as Git, VS Code, and PyCharm, and I enjoy exploring libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me for collaboration or just to share ideas. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!
